        "\n",
        "### **📌 Problem Statement**\n",
        "Food wastage is a critical global issue where large quantities of edible food go to waste due to inefficient distribution, limited food-sharing networks, and lack of coordination between **food providers** (restaurants, supermarkets, etc.) and **receivers** (NGOs, shelters, individuals in need).\n",
        "\n",
        "The purpose of this project is to design and deploy an **end-to-end Food Wastage Management System** that:\n",
        "- Connects **food providers** with **receivers** using a **Streamlit-based interactive dashboard**.\n",
        "- Integrates with a **Neon PostgreSQL database** to store, manage, and query live data.\n",
        "- Performs **Interactive Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** with visualizations.\n",
        "- Monitors **data quality** and provides **operational insights**.\n",
        "- Allows **CRUD operations** (Add, View, Update) for Providers, Receivers, Claims, and Food Items.\n",
        "- Is fully deployed and accessible on **Hugging Face Spaces**.\n",
        "\n",
        "---\n",

        "### **Step 2: Database Connection & Caching**\n",
        "- Implement **DatabaseManager** class using `psycopg2` for connection handling.\n",
        "- Use **`@st.cache_resource`** for connection caching and **`@st.cache_data`** for caching datasets.\n",
        "- Add retry logic for database failures and automatic type conversion (fix for `numpy.int64` → `int`).\n",

        "   - Claims trend over time.\n",
        "5. **Data Quality Assessment (Fixed Column Mapping)**\n",
        "   - Checks completeness, missing values, duplicates.\n",
        "6. **Insights Generation**\n",
        "   - Summarizes business KPIs (active cities, claims success rate, etc.).\n",
